This library contains simple helper functions I have written for Drupal 7.14 in PHP.

* checkUserRole - allows for simple and easy role-based authentication in your custom PHP code using the functionality built into Drupal.
* createExternalLink - returns a hyperlink to a page with custom display text (which presumably leads to an external website) that you want to open in a new tab or window so the user doesn't leave the page that they are currently reading.
